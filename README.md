This app is intended to be a simple deck builder. A user can create "an account", add decks, and add cards to their decks. It's very simple in its existing state but I'm just happy I was able to pull in a third party api for now. 

Technologies used: 
-Mongo
-Mongoose
-Express
-Node
-React
-Semantic Ui
-Magic the Gathering api: https://magicthegathering.io/
coupled with MTG SDK: https://github.com/MagicTheGathering/mtg-sdk-javascript

App 2.0:

Cards need to be combined down so that when there are two or more of a card in a user deck, it displays the name once, with a quantity count next to it. Would like to implement a search by set or search by text feature as well as limit search results to 20. Eventually, I'd like to add in a deck test feature so that you can grab sample hands from a user deck. Also, a booster pack opening would be super cool.
